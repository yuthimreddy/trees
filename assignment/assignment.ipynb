    "**Q1.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How are trees constructed?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Trees are built by splitting the dataset by features, which can then be used to predict outcomes by following a series of decisions/requirements. Trees consist of stepping stones/blocks called nodes. The starting node, or known as the root node, encompasses the entire dataset. The dataset features make up the internal nodes. The endpoints of nodes are referred to as leaves, which are the final output of the previous nodes/decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do trees handle non-linear relationships between variables? Compare this to linear models. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Trees are used for mapping non-linear data, since there's no relationship between each node and the outcomes which come with. Trees work by splitting the data into subsets based on the features values and can demonstrate the relations/interactions between variables in an easily comprehensive manner. Linear models are better for variables which demonstrate linearity which can illustrate the differences in distance from each feature compared to the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables? \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Gini is helpful as it measures the likelihood of an element being misclassified. A lower Gini index/score indicates that the node hosts elements of similar class which is what we want as we hope our model is effectively splitting data based off the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained? \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Decision trees can grow to be too complex and overfit and oversized as they usually include features that may be irrelevant. Decision trees often learn the noise and other irrelevant features that make it harder to apply towards newer datasets. Too many splits/nodes can result in overfitting as well, as there are too many splits specific to the training data given. To mitigate this, we can use pruning to reduce the size of the decision tree by removing parts which are seemingly irrelevant or not helpful in predicting target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   False: decision trees can perform well with both categorical and numeric features. Decision trees can work with numerical data by finding the most optimal split point based on certain threshold values, in contrast to categorical variables which split based on categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Splitting more than twice can lead to overfitting, as the splits may be too specific towards the data, whereas binary trees split more gradually which can help generalize the tree better towards new data. Having more than two branches also means that the tree model would have to be considering an additional level of combinations of groups which can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Looking at the tree, we can gauge its fit based on how many branches and nodes are available. A high number of levels may be a sign of overfitting as there are many levels indicating a higher depth. Shallow trees with very little branches/leaves can be indicative of an under-fitting model that could be more specific with its categorization.\n"

For numeric variables, we'll use `Mileage_Run`, `Make_Year`, and `Seating_Capacity`. Our target variable will be `Price`. Make a train-test split of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From `sklearn.tree`, import the `DecisionTreeRegressor` and `plot_tree`. Use a train-test split to iterate over possible values for `min_samples_leaf`, computing the $R^2$ for each value between 1 and 25. What choice achieves the highest $R^2$ on the test data?\n",

    "**Q4.** This is a case study about trees using bond rating data. This is a dataset about bond ratings for different companies, alongside a bunch of business statistics and other data. Companies often have multiple reviews at different dates. We want to predict the bond rating (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, ..., C, D). Do business fundamentals predict the company's rating?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the `./data/corporate_ratings.csv` dataset. How many observations and variables does it contain? Print out the first few rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Plot a histogram of the `ratings` variable. It turns out that the gradations of AAA/AA/A and BBB/BB/B and so on make it hard to get good results with trees. Collapse all AAA/AA/A ratings into just A, and similarly for B and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use all of the variables **except** Rating, Date, Name, Symbol, and Rating Agency Name. To include Sector, make a dummy/one-hot-encoded representation and include it in your features/covariates. Collect the relevant variables into a data matrix $X$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Do a train/test split of the data and use a decision tree classifier to predict the bond rating. Including a min_samples_leaf constraint can raise the accuracy and speed up computation time. Print a confusion matrix and the accuracy of your model. How well do you predict the different bond ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If you include the rating agency as a feature/covariate/predictor variable, do the results change? How do you interpret this?"

There are over-sampling techniques to deal with this issue, but we don't have time to cover them in class.\n",

Predict it using a decision tree regressor (making sure to drop Class, Time, and Loss from the features/covariates/predictors). What $R^2$ and RMSE do you get? Make a scatterplot of the predicted values on the test group versus the actual test values. Do you notice any interesting patterns?
